In the below, <lsw2 trunk> is the checked out trunk directory for lsw2
<repositories> is the directory where you keep checked out working copies
I assume you are using emacs.

To get going:

- Set up ABCL:
-- Have Java 8
-- Get a recent Armed Bear Common Lisp, e.g. using svn:
```svn co http://abcl.org/svn/trunk/abcl/```
Note: LSW currently assumes that ```abcl``` and ```lsw2`` ("<lsw2 trunk>" below) directories have the same parent directory. Some people put them both in ```~``` to satisfy that requirement.
-- Build ABCL "all in one" jar by running ```ant abcl-aio.jar``` in the ```abcl``` directory

Check out the current version of slime from github
cd <repositories>
git clone https://github.com/slime/slime.git

Then add to your .emacs

(add-to-list 'load-path "<repositories>/slime")
(set-language-environment "UTF-8")
(setq slime-net-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
(require 'slime-autoloads)
(setq slime-contribs '(slime-repl slime-fancy slime-asdf))

(setq slime-lisp-implementations
 '((lsw ("<lsw2 trunk>") :init slime-init-command)
   (abcl ("<lsw2 trunk>/bin/abcl --noinit") :init slime-init-command)))

The slime contribs settings are documented at 
http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Loading-Contribs.html

To start LSW, start emacs and then M-x slime <ret>

You should be placed into a buffer where you can execute code.

To verify the kit's working do

(show-classtree "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo.owl")

You should get a window with an interactive treemap explorer to wander
around the BFO ontology. Click on one of the labels.

To develop, you'll probably want to read about slime:
http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/index.html, which is
your emacs-based IDE.
