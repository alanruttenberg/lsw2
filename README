In the below, <lsw2 trunk> is the checked out trunk directory for lsw2
<repositories> is the directory where you keep checked out working copies
I assume you are using emacs.

To get going:

Check out the current version of slime from github
cd <repositories>
git clone https://github.com/slime/slime.git

Then add to your .emacs

(add-to-list 'load-path "<repositories>/slime")
(set-language-environment "UTF-8")
(setq slime-net-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
(require 'slime-autoloads)
(setq slime-contribs '(slime-repl slime-fancy slime-asdf))

(setq slime-lisp-implementations
 '((lsw ("<lsw2 trunk>") :init slime-init-command)
   (abcl ("<lsw2 trunk>/bin/abcl --noinit") :init slime-init-command)))

The slime contribs settings are documented at
