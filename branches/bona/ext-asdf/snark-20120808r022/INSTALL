SNARK is run regularly in
 Macintosh Common Lisp on Mac OS X
 Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) on Mac OS X
 Clozure Common Lisp (CCL nee OpenMCL) on Mac OS X
and has been run in other ANSI Common Lisp systems

After editing for the correct name and location of the SBCL Lisp system in the appropriate make-xxx file
a 32-bit executable of SNARK in SBCL named snark can be made by ./make-snark-sbcl;
a 64-bit executable of SNARK in SBCL named snark64 can be make by ./make-snark-sbcl64.

After editing for the correct name and location of the CCL Lisp system in the appropriate make-xxx file
a 32-bit executable of SNARK in CCL named snark-ccl can be made by ./make-snark-ccl;
a 64-bit executable of SNARK in CCL named snark-ccl64 can be maded by ./make-snark-ccl64



Older detailed instructions:

(replace "yyyymmdd" by the SNARK version date)

Installing SNARK:

  tar xfz snark-yyyymmdd.tar.gz
  cd snark-yyyymmdd
  lisp
  (load "snark-system.lisp")
  (make-snark-system t)			;t specifies compilation
  (make-snark-system t)			;compile again for more inlining (optional)
					;can use :optimize instead of t to compile for
					;higher speed at the expense of less error checking
  (quit)

Running SNARK:

  lisp
  (load "snark-system.lisp")
  (make-snark-system)			;loads SNARK files compiled above
  :

The lengthy load process in running SNARK can be eliminated
for CCL, SBCL, CMUCL, Allegro Common Lisp, or CLISP by doing
   lisp
   (load "snark-system.lisp")
   (make-snark-system)
   (save-snark-system)
after installing SNARK as above.
(save-snark-system) will print instructions for running
the resulting Lisp core image with SNARK preloaded.

In the case of SBCL, (save-snark-system) can be replaced by
(save-snark-system :name "snark" :executable t)
to create a standalone SNARK executable. This is done
by the make-snark-sbcl and make-snark-sbcl64 scripts.
