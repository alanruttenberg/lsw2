SPARQL-DL API - in short
----------------------------------

The SPARQL-DL query engine is settled on top of the OWL API. The library is fully aligned with the OWL 2 standard and adds a SPARQL-DL interface to every OWL API reasoner.

The SPARQL-DL query language is a distinct subset of SPARQL (a query language for RDF). The subset is tailored to ontology specific questions which typically come into focus when dealing with OWL. SPARQL-DL is a quite expressive language which particularly allows to mix TBox, RBox, and ABox queries. SPARQL-DL originally was introduced by Sirin and Parsia in 2007. We have extended the query language to cover all of OWL 2 and provide this query engine on top of the OWL API.
