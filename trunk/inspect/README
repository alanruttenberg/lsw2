Reflective inspectors, other UI tools, etc.
  -- Mike Travers 4/2007

To use:

Load:
(asdf::oos 'asdf::load-op 'inspect)

Make a window and then inspects it:
(oinspect (make-window "foo" 100 100))

Browsing RDF:
With default KB loaded:

(make-instance 'rdf-inspector-window
  :object !<http://ecocyc.org/compound/d-galacturonate>
  :show-inverse t)

Inspect over SPARQL:

(make-instance 'rdf-inspector-window
  :reasoner !<http://dbpedia.org/sparql/?>
  :from-graphs (list !<http://dbpedia.org>)
  :show-inverse t
  :object !<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soyuz_TM-6>)

Or:
(oinspect-sparql-endpoint (make-uri "http://spade.lbl.gov:2021/sparql"))

The global variable *inspected* should be bound to the value of the last
inspected object.


To graph relations as you traverse them, do this:
(make-instance 'inspect-graph)


Bugs/feature requests: 
- smarter sizing of columns
- visible history
- link to prefuse or other grapher
- knows about more kinds of Java objects
- can get fields out of Java objects 
- smarter about errors that occur during data fetch (ie, prefuse Display objects)
- CLOS instance inspect needs to deal with unbound fields
- structure inspect
- handle dotted list
- smarter history; disable BACK button when appropriate
- close-all-inspecters
- tooltips wrong for Java objects
