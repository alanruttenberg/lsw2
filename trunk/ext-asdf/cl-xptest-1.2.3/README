xptest - An "Extreme Programming" test framework for Comon Lisp
======================================================================

xptest is a framework for building test cases, managing test data, and
putting these together into test suites.  It provides a minimal level
of support for reports on test runs.  It's also a nice development
tool in that one can easily use it for organizing code fragments when
developing more complex features.


License (well, non-License)
======================================================================
xptest is in the public domain.  It's so simple that even a copyright
is just a pathetic clinging some romantic notion of the author.


Installation
======================================================================

xptest uses defsystem, so your lisp needs to support defsystem.  You
may need to modify the XPTest.system file in order to tell defsystem
where the source files are stored, and/or set up the appropirate
logial path translations.  Alternatively you can just load up the
files by hand.
