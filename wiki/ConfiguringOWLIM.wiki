#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

This page describes how to install OWLIM-Lite and configure it for use with the R21 system.



= Preliminaries = 
  # Have Java (get it [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html here])
  # Download [http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi Apache Tomcat 7] (get the zip immediately under "Core" under "Binary Distributions". There's a copy of a version known to work in OSX/Unix in trunk/owl2/lib/tomcat/
  # Register for and download [http://www.ontotext.com/owlim/owlim-lite-registration OWLIM-Lite]
 # I'll assume you have an environment variable $LSW that points to the trunk of LSW
= Installation =
  
  # Unzip and Configure Tomcat
    * Configuration involves setting a few environment variables, as described in the file '[http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/RUNNING.txt RUNNING.txt]' in the tomcat directory. 
 ** export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
 ** export CATALINA_HOME=$LSW/owl2/lib/tomcat/

  # Unzip OWLIM
  # Deploy OWLIM's version *openrdf-sesame.war* and *openrdf-workbench.war* by copying them into _$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps_ as described in the [http://owlim.ontotext.com/display/OWLIMv52/OWLIM-Lite+Installation#OWLIM-LiteInstallation-Easyinstall Easy Install] section of the OWLIM Installation Guide


= Running and Creating a Repository =
  # Increase the Java VM size for Tomcat. Below we set it to 2 gig, but you might have to set it higher depending on your KB
            export CATALINA_OPTS="-server -Xmx2048m" 
  # Run Tomcat:
             _$TOMCAT_HOME/startup.sh_
  # Go to http://localhost:8080/openrdf-workbench/ in a browser
  # Click on "New Repository" in the upper left hand corner
  # Select _OWLIM-Lite_, fill in an ID and Type, and click _Next_
  # On the next page, select any desired options and click _Create_


= Using the Repository =
  * Return to http://localhost:8080/openrdf-workbench to view and select the repository
  * Note the repository location (e.g., http://localhost:8080/openrdf-sesame/repositories/owlim-lite-test). The SPARQL endpoint for a repository is _$LOCATION_/query (e.g., http://localhost:8080/openrdf-sesame/repositories/owlim-lite-test/query)
  * Queries can also be run within the openrdf workbench by clicking on "Query" on the left-hand side
  * Load OWL files using SPARQL Update (also on the LHS), e.g.
{{{
load <file:///Users/jonathanbona/ontology/ohd-ontology/src/ontology/pitt-ub-ohsu-r21/imports/BFO2/bfo2.owl>; 
load <file:///Users/jonathanbona/ontology/ohd-ontology/src/ontology/pitt-ub-ohsu-r21/ohd.owl>;
}}}
    This takes forever.
