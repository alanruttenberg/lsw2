The function loadOnt (below) takes two arguments, a file name string and a string of what you want to uri to be, and returns an ontology.
The file must include tab delimited "triples" (e.g. loves bob susan) separated by newlines.
The triples are asserted as object property assertions in OWL. The function readRecords does the necessary parsing.
 
 example usage:
 (setf ont (loadOnt (readRecords "dummy-records.txt" "http://www.purl.org/newOntology/")))
 
 dummy-records.txt:
hasWife	Bob	Sally <cr>
hasBrother	Bill	Tim <cr>
hasSister	Sally	Megan <cr>
 
 To output the results in owl:
(to-owl-syntax foo :rdfxml)

 <rdf:Description rdf:about=\"http://www.purl.org/newOntology/Bill\">
        <www:newOntology/hasBrother rdf:resource=\"http://www.purl.org/newOntology/Tim\"/>
