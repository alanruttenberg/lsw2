#summary How to run FMA experiments with Kidney

= Introduction =

These instruction explain how to run prototype code to convert aspects of the FMA into OWL


= Installation =

Assume are installing into ~/repos/

<pre>
cd ~/repos
svn co https://lsw2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk lsw2
cd lsw2
svn co http://svn.neurocommons.org/svn/trunk/convert/fma
</pre>

get a version of the SQL dump of the FMA. Here's one, in protege 3.4 database format

<pre>wget http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4905123/fma_11-20-09_p3.4.zip</pre>

Here's a later version in the earlier sql format (but a later version of fma)

<pre>wget http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4905123/fma_3_12_10.zip</pre>

unzip it to get  fma_3_12_10.sql

<pre>unzip fma_3_12_10.zip</pre>

Start up lsw:

<pre>bin/lsw</pre>

Tell LSW where the sql is:

<pre>(setq *fma-sql-path* "path to fma sql")</pre>

Load the FMA code:

<pre>(asdf::oos 'asdf::load-op 'fma2)</pre>

Read in FMA

if 3.4 compatible protege sql
<pre>(read-fma-sql)</pre>

if earlier format
<pre>(read-fma-sql-old-style)</pre>

Run the kidney conversion

<pre>(kidney-experiment)</pre>

Will print some stuff. (setq *log-assertions* t) if you want to see more.

After a few minutes it will have written the following 6 files in the fma directory:

<pre>
-rw-r--r--  1 alanr  alanr    776907 May  5 13:26 kidney-partonomy-treeml.xml
-rw-r--r--  1 alanr  alanr    108113 May  5 13:25 kidney-partonomy.owl
-rw-r--r--  1 alanr  alanr  21074336 May  5 13:25 kidney-hierarchy-with-part-types-treeml.xml
-rw-r--r--  1 alanr  alanr   1249887 May  5 13:22 kidney-hierarchy-with-part-types.owl
-rw-r--r--  1 alanr  alanr   1531214 May  5 13:22 kidney-hierarchy-treeml.xml
-rw-r--r--  1 alanr  alanr   1049349 May  5 13:21 kidney-hierarchy.owl
</pre>

The treeml.xml files are what are behind the web pages such as http://ashby.csail.mit.edu/treeview/kidney-partonomy.html

There are three OWL files generated:

  * kidney-hierarchy.owl - the hierarchy plus part relationships
  * kidney-hierarchy-with-part-types.owl - the above plus classes "part some x" for all classes in the hierarchy. This file is used to derived the partonomy
  * kidney-partonomy.owl - a derived partonomy - not that the subclass relations here mean "part" not "is_a" - this is for visualization.

In the lisp environment these are bound to the variables k1, k2, k3, respectively.

To browse the partonomy in lisp, 

<pre>(show-classtree k3)</pre>

Anything at the top level is probably something that needs to be repaired.
